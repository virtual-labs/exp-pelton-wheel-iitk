A constant speed is maintained by varying the discharge (by changing spear position) as the load changes. From the measured discharge (Q), head (almost constant), power developed (P) and overall efficiency (ƞo), are calculated and curves are plotted between efficiency (ƞo), power (P) and the discharge (Q).<br><br>
7.1	Formulae –<br><br>

1.	Discharge (Q) = K Sqrt(h)   LPM<br>
K is a constant depends on venturi meter dimensions<br><br>

2.	Shaft Power/Brake Power developed (B.P)<br>
B.P = 2πNWRex9.81/60,000    kW<br>
Where N = speed in RPM<br>
              W = Load applied on brake drum (N)<br>
               Re = Effective radius of the brake drum in meters<br><br>

3.	Water Power<br>
W.P = wQH/1000  kW<br>
Where w = Specific weight of water (9810 N/m<sup>3</sup>)<br>
              Q = Discharge in m<sup>3</sup>/s (as calculated at 1)<br>
              H = Head (of water) acting on Pelton Turbine<br><br>

4.	Overall Efficiency<br> 
ƞ<sub>o</sub> = B.P/W.P<br><br>
